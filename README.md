# PokiAPI

This was a project that I used to learn about using API's.
I came across this Pokemon API at https://pokeapi.co/ and I found a Pokemon style font and worked to create something to allow a user to search for a pokemon by the ID number.
When the user enters an ID number, the app presents the user with the pokemon's name, height and an image of the pokemon.

This app was a great project to learn about API's, but I also learned a lot about Javascript while I was working on it.
